PROJECT TITLE:
                                                        AMBUNEXUS: A Smart Ambulance System
DESCRIPTION:

AmbuNexus is an AI-driven Smart Ambulance System designed to address critical issues in ambulance services like unpredictable vehicle breakdowns, traffic congestion, and poor patient-hospital coordination. The system features predictive maintenance, dynamic traffic-aware routing with signal control, and real-time patient data streaming. Its goal is to keep ambulances operational, expedite arrival times, and ensure hospitals are fully prepared for incoming patients.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Imagine a high-stakes, life-or-death emergency unfolding in real-time. Your very survival hangs in the balance, but the ambulance, your only hope, grinds to an unforeseen halt, its vital systems failing without warning. Every second is a battlefield, yet the ambulance becomes a sitting duck, a fragile vessel trapped in an unforgiving sea of gridlocked traffic, as the precious "golden hour" for your survival vanishes.
This isn't just an inconvenience; it's a gap in the very chain of survival. Without a solution to these life-threatening delays and coordination failures, emergency services are critically compromised, and patient outcomes are left entirely to chance. The ability to predict a breakdown, bypass traffic, and prepare a hospital is not a luxuryâ€”it is the difference between life and death.


 Our Model AmbuNexus has three Functionalities:
1.Vehicle failure Predictive Maintenance
2.Route optimization for the ambulance
3.patient outcome prediction

Installation and Setup Instructions for "1.Vehicle failure Predictive Maintenance:"





Installation and Setup Instructions for "3.patient outcome prediction"
Step 1: Save the Code Files
Save the Python code provided into a file named train_model.py.
Save the HTML code provided into a file named index.html.

Step 2: Set Up the Python Backend
First, install the necessary Python libraries by running the following command in your terminal:
Bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
Next, execute the Python script to generate the synthetic data and train the model:
Bash
python train_model.py
This command will create two new files: ambulance_patient_data.csv and ambulance_patient_outcome_model.pkl.

Step 3: Launch the Web Frontend
Simply open the index.html file in any web browser to run the application.
